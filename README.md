# Install the necessary libraries
Make sure to have Python 3 with pip installed, and head over to the `datics-butterfly-project` repository on your machine. In that folder, open a command line interface, and type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This installs all the libraries necessary to run the notebooks smoothly.
