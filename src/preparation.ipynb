    "The subgroup that will work on this project involves 4 motivated students named Max, Jochem, Pol, and Lars.\n",
    "<h3>1.2 Naturalis </h3>\n",
    "<p>Naturalis is the national research institute for biodiversity. Their scientists dedicate themselves to describing, understanding and preserving biodiversity without interruption.</p> \n",
    "<h3>1.3 Project goal </h3>\n",
    "<p>Figure 4 and 5 below display the current and desired situations, these images bring our goal into perspective</p>\n",
    "    <h4>1.3.1 Current situation </h4>\n",
    "<p>They are working on a project that focuses on animal species recognition. One of the key problems with biodiversity studies is the correct identification of animals and insects. Naturalis currently uses Image Recognition Models (IRM) with the addition of species distribution models (SDM). SDM’s models can predict the probability that an animal species will occur at a certain time or location (By using geo-factors). This can improve species recognition when the photo quality is low and the species are indistinguishable from each other. The model is currently integrated into the Iobs app in the app store and the Obsmapp app in the google play store. With this app, users can photograph animals or insects and identify the animal, based on IDM’s and SMD’s. </p>\n",

    "<h4>1.3.1 Desired situation </h4>\n",
    "<p>As described in the chapter above, there are currently 2 issues with the current way the algorithm is deciding which species are seen in the images. Those issues are that images have low quality or can’t determine the species because it looks the same as another species.</p> \n",
    "<p>To overcome these problems we want to create an AI-model that predicts the species for the animals using image recognitions in combination with geographical information. That way the SDM will be more accurate which makes it easier to predict where a species will live in the future and how it will develop itself.</p> \n",
    "<p>The project involves creating a business proposal where we will determine the scope of the project and get a clear goal to work towards during the project. We will also take a first look at the data that is available and do some exploratory data analysis so that we get to know the data and get a feeling for the things that are possible for us to do.</p> \n",
    "<p>After the exploratory data analysis and the business proposal, we work towards building a Deep Learning model that will determine the species that is shown on pictures. Before we can start with that we will need to clean up the data so that the model will be more accurate and comes with better results.</p> \n",
    "<p>When the project is finished we will put all our findings in our final report and give a presentation to the company.</p> \n",
    "<p>With the working model that Datics will provide, the accuracy of the butterfly detection, Image Detection Model should increase with the help of the SDM model. The final goal is to make sure that the model works on all species if the data is given. The application should be able to detect the differences between animals that look similar and are not distinguishable by IDM’s with the help of the SDM’s. The group will also provide advice with the final report where any further ideas on how to improve the SDM or the process in identifying the species. </p> \n",
